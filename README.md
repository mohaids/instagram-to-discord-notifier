# instagram-to-discord-notifier


## Project Purpose
To provide a discrete and customizable method to receive desktop Instagram notifications via Discord.

Let's say you didn't want to get these pesky Instagram notifications:

But you STILL want to know when someone DMs you.

With this project you can: 
1. Get a notification of that notification via a familiar (read: better) interface: Discord
2. And you are able to customize the notification of that notification you get

Here's an example of what the customized notifications could look like:

## Project Overview:
This project runs a stealthy, headless Instagram monitor inside a Docker container that checks for new DMs and notifies a private Discord server via webhook ‚Äî without relying on mobile notifications or app tracking.

Using a cookie-authenticated, headless Chrome session powered by undetected-chromedriver, the bot detects new messages by monitoring changes in the Instagram inbox tab title. When a DM is received, the container immediately sends a custom Discord alert.

_New approach:_ Fully headless browser automation inside a Docker container, cloud-deployable, cookie-based login
_Old approach (still included for reference):_ GUI-based Chrome on EC2, accessed via RealVNC, routed through a Raspberry Pi proxy

## Project Evolution:
| Version | Key Tech Stack | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| v0 (Ancient) | EC2, RealVNC, Secrets Manager, **RaspberryPi** | GUI-based bot hosted on EC2, accessed via VNC **and routed through a home proxy** |
| v1 (Legacy) | EC2, RealVNC, Secrets Manager | GUI-based bot hosted on EC2, accessed via VNC|
| v2 (Current) | Docker, Headless Chrome, Discord Webhooks | Containerized, cloud-portable version using headless Chrome and runtime secrets |

See [/docs-aws](/docs-aws) for the original GUI-based EC2 setup.

## Current Architecture (v2)

### Security Considerations:
1. AWS Secrets Manager
2. Limited IAM User permissions
    - for accessing AWS Secrets Manager

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Bot logic and automation via Selenium
- **Selenium + undetected-chromedriver**: Headless, stealthy browser automation
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment
- **Discord Webhooks**: Notification delivery
- **Google Chrome**: Used in headless mode inside container

## Cloud Deployment Tools
- **AWS ECS (Fargate)**: Serverless container runtime for persistent cloud hosting
- **Amazon ECR**: For hosting Docker images
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Optional secret storage for webhooks or session cookies
- **AWS CLI**: For provisioning and deployment

### Previously Used Technologies
- AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)
- RealVNC Viewer (GUI access to browser)
- Raspberry Pi 4B (proxy server)


## Setup Instructions

This project supports two deployment paths:

### üê≥ Docker (Recommended)
Run the bot locally or in the cloud using Docker. No EC2 or GUI setup required.

1. Local Hosting:
- Follow [build-image.md](./docs-docker/build-image.md) to build your Docker image.
- Then follow [run-locally.md](./docs-docker/run-locally.md) to run an instance of that image (i.e. a container) locally.

2. AWS-Hosting:
- Follow [build-image.md](./docs-docker/build-image.md) to build your Docker image.
- Then follow [deploy-to-ecs.md](./docs-docker/deploy-to-ecs.md) to deploy the container on AWS (using ECS and ECR). 

For a full overview of all Docker-related files, see [docs-docker/readme.md](./docs-docker/).

### ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS EC2 (Legacy / GUI-based)
1. Manual Provisioning: Follow the [docs-aws/readme.md](./docs-aws/) file for detailed instructions.

2. Currently, doing this project via IaC tools is on hold due to scope creep.
